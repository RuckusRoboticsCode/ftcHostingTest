# Open RC

# NOTE
Not at all up to date. Don't use anymore.

[OpenRC](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenRC-Turbo) is a modified version of the official SDK that makes uploading code quicker, but it also removes many features. Aside from that, because it isn't officially supported, often it isn't the newest version of the SDK. Also, if you aren't using the "stock" version, it is not competition legal. This is useful when developing and testing code so that re-uploading is faster.
