# Version Control: Git

### What is Version Control

Version control is a way to keep track of changes. It's kind of like version history in google doc, but for changes inside of files as well as moving files and renaming them.

### Why is it important

Git is a good way to keep progress if something breaks. If you regularly upload to git and something happens to your computer, everything is right there and you barely lost anything. 

Git is also good for working with other people on the same project because you will each be able to update code and see when each of you uploads. The only thing is, try not to edit the same file and each upload. This will be what's called a merge conflict and is kind of annoying.

### Why Git?

Git is really lightweight and uploading large amounts of code is really quick. Not only that, but it's widely supported any many programs have git support built-in. For example, VScode and Android Studio both have git built in for the user so they don't have to type commands in terminal.
