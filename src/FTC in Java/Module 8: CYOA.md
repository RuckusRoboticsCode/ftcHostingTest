I have written modules for

1. [Computer Vision](./Computer%20Vision/EasyOpenCV/EOCV%200%3A%20Basics.md)
2. [Control Structure](./Control%20Structures/)
3. [Control Theory](https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf)
4. [Electronics](./Electronics/)
5. [More Java & OOP](./Optional%20Programming/More%20Java%20&%20OOP/)
6. [Other Tools](./Other%20Tools/)
7. [Motion Profiling & Path Following](./Path%20Following/)

It's going to be a weird jump to any of them and there isn't any particular order that is "best" to learn them in, so whichever you think is more important and interest, learn that one if you wish to continue.
