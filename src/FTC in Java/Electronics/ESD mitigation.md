# Electrostatic Discharge Mitigation

### Methods

I am basing this section based on [this analysis](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/analysis-esd-mitigation-echin.pdf) that someone else conducted.

**Grounding Strap**

Plug the [grounding strap](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1269/) into the hub and screw it onto the metal from of the robot. This will reduce the likely hood to the robot breaking from static and generally prevents any damage.

**Ferrite Clamps**

I'm not sure of the science behind why [these](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-39-1224-pk4/) help mitigate discharge, but they also help reduce noise, so these can be used around data cables as well.

**Dryer Sheets**

Between rounds you can discharge the robot by brushing it with dryer sheets. These absorb any static and hopefully reduce it enough between matches.

**Cover Metal Frame**

Prevent static buildup on the robot by covering the metal frame with an insulative material. The parts of the robot closest to the ground should be covered as well as any parts that get close to metal game elements.

**No Exposed Wires**

Wires that are exposed to the air or touching the metal frame can give the static somewhere to discharge, so if you aren't using a wire, take it off the robot or plug it in.
