# Tank Drive TeleOp

## What is a "TeleOp"?

"TeleOp" is what we call programs where the player can control the robot with the controllers.

## What is "Tank Drive"?

Tank drive refers to driving the robot with the left side synchronized and the right side synchronized (like there are treads connecting them). This way, we can have the left joystick control the left motors and the right joystick control the right motors.

## Gamepad Input

The "Gamepad" tab contains all the blocks we need to interact with the controllers and get values from them.

This just puts the number that is being read from gamepad1's Left joystick in the Y direction.
