### Overview
In computer science, we often deal with lots of data, and thus we need robust methods to deal with collections of data. We thus have different formats, data structures (also known as aggregate data types), to arrange, process, access and store data. 

When thinking about the most appropriate data structure to implement, we need to consider its characteristics: 
- Contents: Types of values that can be stored
  - Heterogenous: Data points of different data types can be stored. 
  - Homogenous: Only data points of the same data type can be stored. 
- Size: The number of elements that can be stored in a data structure
  - Static: Once set the size of the data set can not be changed. 
  - Dynamic: The size of the data set can be changed. 
 - Element access: How efficiently can different elements be inserted deleted or updated
  - Sequential access: The program has to go through each element in a sequence in order to access a given value. For example think of a binary tree!
  - Random access: There exists a means to access a specific data point in the structure. For example think of an array! 

### Types
- Arrays: 
  - Homogenous
  - Static
  - Random Access
- Linked list
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap 
- Hashing 
- Graph
