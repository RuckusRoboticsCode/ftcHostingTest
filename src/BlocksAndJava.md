# Blocks Vs. Java

Okay, this will be a strongly opinionated module, so consider the pros and cons I propose for yourself and with your team before you make a decision.

### Blocks

Blocks are good because they're simple and help people learn. However, you leave a lot of performance on the table.

### Java

There are optimizations that are only available in Java. Additionally, it's easier to organize code that makes it easier to debug and edit. 
Overally, I would HIGHLY recommend FTC programmers to work in Java. It's also just a more useful skill to have if you want to do anything 
Computer Science related in the future.
